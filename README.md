# eyes
This progect uses javascript to create a simulated dynamic eye movement following the mouse. This is accomplished by using arrays and loops with adequate CSS syling. 

How to run: Copy the index.html file link found in the eyes folder then paste in https://htmlpreview.github.io to preview.

Roadmap to future improvement: Attempt inverting the action of the eyeballs so it moves opposite the mouse movement.
